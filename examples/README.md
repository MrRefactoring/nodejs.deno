#	How to run examples?

Some examples depend on [deno_std](https://github.com/denoland/deno_std/), you may clone the repository and put it under *denoland* folder which is at the same level with *example* folder:

```bash
+ deno
  + denoland
    + deno_std
  + examples
    + datetime
	+ misc
	...
```
